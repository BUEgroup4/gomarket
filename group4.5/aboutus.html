                <h2>What do you know about us ?</h2>
                     <p>
                         Not long ago, shopping in Egypt has been quite a tedious, time-consuming task involving several weekly visits to a huge number of small, specialized shops. With changes in today’s lifestyle, consumers have developed a taste for quality packaged goods, and more women – the typical house managers- have joined the work force. To fulfill consumers’ needs, Mansour Holdings believed it was time to introduce a more convenient means of shopping in Egypt.An initial in-depth survey of the country’s shopping scene revealed that although some small chain supermarkets did exist, there was plenty of room for improvement. GOs Holdings aimed to round off its distribution operation by introducing a new supermarket chain, which would eventually grow to over 96 outlets nationwide.

                <h2>OPERATIONS</h2>
                     <p>
                        The first ten GO supermarkets swung into business in both Cairo and Alex, while the target was to open at least eight more stores in the following years. By the beginning of 2017 , GO reached a network of 36 stores covering five different governorates including Cairo, Giza, Alex, Mansoura, Ismailia, Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh. Today, GO has become the biggest food retail chain in the market with a network of 48 outlets servicing several governorates nationwide, further solidifying GO’s position as the biggest chain supermarket in Egypt.

                     <p>
                        Under the umbrella of GO Market, GO Holdings started the Kan Zaman chain in 2008 which offers a variety or food products at affordable prices to satisfy the lower income segment of the consumers. Today the chain has grown to reach a total of 38 outlets and will continue to grow in the future. This is in conjunction with GOs Holding’s Corporate Social Responsibility mission.
                        In 2017 GO Markets added “Fast” to “Freshness” when 2 Mini GO stores opened in 6th of October City and Heliopolis. GO stores are responding to the 18 – 30 age groups who want high quality and fast service for a limited range of items.
